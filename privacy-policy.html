    <h1>Privacy Policy for Prep Dost</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Prep Dost</strong> ("App," "we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect and How It's Used</h2>

    <h3>A. Locally Stored Data (Your Device Only)</h3>
    <p><strong>Prep Dost is designed to keep your personal study data private and on your device. We do NOT collect or store your personal study information on our cloud servers or any external databases.</strong> This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Name:</strong> When you provide your name for personalization, it is stored **only on your local device**. We use it solely to greet you within the App and personalize your in-app experience. Your name is not linked to any online accounts or transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Study Analytics & Progress:</strong> Your mock test scores, test history, study plan details, topic completion status, and any other performance or progress data generated from your use of the App are stored **exclusively on your mobile device**. This data is used solely to provide you with your personal analytics, history, and progress tracking within the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please be aware that since this data is stored locally, if you uninstall the App, clear its data, or reset your device, this information may be permanently lost as we do not have a backup.</p>

    <h3>B. Automatically Collected Usage Data (Aggregated & Non-Identifiable)</h3>
    <p>When you use our App, we may automatically collect certain general, non-identifiable usage information to help us understand how the App is being used and to improve its performance and features. This "Usage Data" may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system version).</li>
        <li>App crash reports.</li>
        <li>General interactions with App features (e.g., how often a certain screen is visited, general feature usage statistics).</li>
        <li>IP address (typically anonymized or used to infer general geographic location).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Usage Data is collected in an aggregated and anonymized form, meaning it does not directly identify you or link back to your personal name, study progress, or other locally stored data.</p>

    <h3>C. Information You Provide Voluntarily (When Using Specific Features)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Chat Interactions:</strong> If you use the AI chat feature, your questions and the AI's responses are processed temporarily to provide the service. These interactions may be logged and used in an **anonymized and aggregated form** to improve the AI model's performance and accuracy. They are not stored in a way that identifies you personally.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you choose to provide feedback through the App (e.g., via a link to a Google Form), any information you submit will be handled according to the privacy policy of the third-party platform used for collecting feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data (Summary)</h2>
    <p>We use the collected (and locally stored) data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the functionality of the App (e.g., personalize your experience, track your progress).</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot and fix technical issues.</li>
        <li>Understand user behavior in an aggregated way to enhance App features and user experience.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclosure of Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. We may disclose anonymized, aggregated Usage Data to third-party service providers (like analytics providers) to analyze App usage, but this data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
    <p>We may also disclose your Personal Data (only if legally compelled) in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of Prep Dost.</li>
        <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the App.</li>
        <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.</li>
        <li>Protect against legal liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Security of Data</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. We implement reasonable measures to protect the information processed by the App. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>Given that most of your personal data is stored locally on your device and not collected by us, your primary control over this data lies in managing the App on your device (e.g., clearing App data or uninstalling). However, concerning any limited data we might process (like aggregated usage data), depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following data protection rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of any Personal Data we may hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to erasure:</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to object to processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we may hold to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Service Providers & Analytics</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party service providers to help us operate and improve the App. These third parties include analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) that help us understand App usage trends. These services typically collect Usage Data in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable form.</p>
    <p>For more information on Google Analytics for Firebase and how Google handles data, please refer to their Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>7. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>Our App may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    <p>We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our App, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
