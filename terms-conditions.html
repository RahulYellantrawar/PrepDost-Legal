    <h1>Terms and Conditions for Prep Dost</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Prep Dost mobile application (the "App") operated by "us", "we", or "our".</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

    <h2>1. The App</h2>
    <p>Prep Dost is a mobile application designed to assist users in preparing for competitive examinations such as SSC, Banking, Railway, and other government job exams. The App provides features including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mock tests based on previous year question papers.</li>
        <li>An AI chat tool for doubt solving.</li>
        <li>A study planner for organizing and tracking study progress.</li>
        <li>Job alerts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Interaction and Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Prep Dost is primarily a **local-storage based application**. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Accounts:</strong> You do not create a cloud-based account with us. Your identity and progress are not linked to an online profile managed by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Any personal information you provide (like your name for personalization), your study analytics, test history, progress, and study plans are stored **exclusively on your mobile device**. This data is not collected, transmitted, or stored on our cloud servers or any external databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Device-Bound Data:</strong> Your in-app progress and personalized data are tied to your specific device. If you uninstall the App, clear its data, or reset your device, this locally stored data may be permanently lost as we do not have a backup.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to these local data storage practices.</p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Prep Dost and its licensors.

Exam conducting bodies may change syllabi, patterns, and marking schemes without prior notice.</p>
    <h3>b. AI Chat (Doubt Solver):</h3>
    <p>The AI chat is an assistive, AI-driven tool. While it aims to provide helpful information and solutions, its responses are generated based on available data and algorithms.

Users should exercise their own judgment and discretion and are encouraged to verify critical information from official academic sources or human experts.</p>
