    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 17, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read this Disclaimer carefully before using the Prep Dost mobile application (the "App") operated by [Prep Dost, if applicable, otherwise "us", "we", or "our"].</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with this Disclaimer. This Disclaimer applies to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Content & Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Prep Dost App is designed to assist users in their preparation for competitive examinations such as SSC, Banking, Railway, and others. It provides the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mock Tests:</strong> All mock tests provided within this App are based on <strong>previous year question papers</strong> of the respective competitive examinations. While we strive for accuracy in presenting these papers, they are reproduced for practice and reference purposes only.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Chat (Doubt Solver):</strong> The AI chat feature is an assistive tool designed to help clarify doubts and provide information related to study topics. The responses generated by the AI are based on its training data and algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Study Planner:</strong> The study planner tool is provided to help users organize their study schedule and track progress. It is a planning aid and does not guarantee specific outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Alerts:</strong> The App provides job alerts based on publicly available information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Accuracy of Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mock Tests (Previous Papers):</strong> While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy and faithful reproduction of previous year question papers, Prep Dost does not guarantee that the mock tests are entirely error-free, exhaustive, or perfectly reflect the current exam patterns, syllabi, or official answer keys. Exam patterns, syllabi, and official answer keys can change without prior notice.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Chat:</strong> The information and solutions provided by the AI chat are for general guidance and educational purposes only. They should not be considered as professional advice or definitive answers. Users are encouraged to cross-reference information with reliable academic sources and consult human experts for critical decision-making or in-depth understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Alerts:</strong> Job alerts are sourced from publicly available information and are subject to change by the issuing authorities. While we strive to provide timely and accurate alerts, we do not guarantee their completeness, accuracy, or real-time updates. Users are strongly advised to verify all job-related information, eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and official notifications directly from the official websites of the respective recruiting organizations.</li>
    </ul>
