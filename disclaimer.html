    <h1>Disclaimer for Prep Dost</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: July 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Please read this Disclaimer carefully before using the Prep Dost mobile application (the "App") operated by "us", "we", or "our".</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with this Disclaimer. This Disclaimer applies to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by this Disclaimer. If you disagree with any part of this Disclaimer, you must not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Nature of Content & Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prep Dost is not affiliated with any government entity. The content is based on publicly available sources and is intended for educational purposes only. We strive to ensure the accuracy of the information, but users are encouraged to verify information from original sources. The Prep Dost App is designed to assist users in their preparation for competitive examinations such as SSC, Banking, Railway, and others. It provides the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mock Tests:</strong> All mock tests provided within this App are based on <strong>previous year question papers</strong> of the respective competitive examinations. While we strive for accuracy in presenting these papers, they are reproduced for practice and reference purposes only.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Chat (Doubt Solver):</strong> The AI chat feature is an assistive tool designed to help clarify doubts and provide information related to study topics. The responses generated by the AI are based on its training data and algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Study Planner:</strong> The study planner tool is provided to help users organize their study schedule and track progress. It is a planning aid and does not guarantee specific outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Alerts:</strong> The App provides job alerts based on publicly available information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Prep Dost is committed to user privacy. We want to be transparent about how your data is handled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Name:</strong> The app collects your name solely for the purpose of personalizing your in-app experience (e.g., greeting you). This name is stored **only on your local device** and is not collected, transmitted, or stored on our cloud servers or any external databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Device Data:</strong> All your personal analytics, history, progress, study plans, and mock test results are saved **exclusively on your mobile device**. We do not collect or store this specific user-generated content on our cloud servers.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Authentication:</strong> Since we do not authenticate users with a cloud account, your in-app progress and personalized data are tied to your specific device. If you uninstall the app or reset your device, this locally stored data may be lost.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate Usage Data:</strong> While personal study data remains local, general, non-identifiable usage data (e.g., app crashes, feature usage statistics) may be collected through standard analytics services (like Google Analytics for Firebase, as mentioned in our Privacy Policy) to help us improve the app's performance and features. This data is aggregated and does not link back to your personal study progress or name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Accuracy of Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mock Tests (Previous Papers):</strong> While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy and faithful reproduction of previous year question papers, Prep Dost does not guarantee that the mock tests are entirely error-free, exhaustive, or perfectly reflect the current exam patterns, syllabi, or official answer keys. Exam patterns, syllabi, and official answer keys can change without prior notice.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Chat:</strong> The information and solutions provided by the AI chat are for general guidance and educational purposes only. They should not be considered as professional advice or definitive answers. Users are encouraged to cross-reference information with reliable academic sources and consult human experts for critical decision-making or in-depth understanding.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Alerts:</strong> Job alerts are sourced from publicly available information and are subject to change by the issuing authorities. While we strive to provide timely and accurate alerts, we do not guarantee their completeness, accuracy, or real-time updates. Users are strongly advised to verify all job-related information, eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and official notifications directly from the official websites of the respective recruiting organizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. No Guarantee of Success</h2>
    <p>The use of this App, including its mock tests, AI chat, study planner, and job alerts, is intended to supplement your study efforts. Prep Dost does not guarantee success or admission in any competitive examination or selection for any job position. Performance in mock tests is an indicator of practice level and may not directly correlate with actual exam performance. Your individual effort, dedication, and other external factors will primarily determine your success.</p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall [Your Company Name/App Name], nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the App; (iii) any content obtained from the App; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
